# Hello there.

My name is Ted Kesgar.

I am an ITB graduate with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. Currently I work at [@bukalapak](https://github.com/bukalapak) and live in Jakarta.

During my spare time, I work on various personal projects. To make working on things easier, I often create public packages that I and everyone else can inspect and use. I mainly use Node.js and JavaScript/TypeScript nowadays. Aside of programming, I enjoy Japanese pop culture, playing video games, and watch football (mostly English football).

I am happy to help fellow developers if I can; I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkesgar). I also lurk on several communities at Telegram or Discord; feel free to say hi.
