# Hello there.

My name is Ted Kesgar.

I am an ITB graduate with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. Currently I work at [@bukalapak](https://github.com/bukalapak) and live in Jakarta. During my spare time, I work on various personal projects. To make working on things easier, I often create public packages that I and everyone else can inspect and use. I mainly use Node.js and JavaScript/TypeScript nowadays.

Aside of programming, I enjoy Japanese pop culture, playing video games, and watch football (mostly English football). I used to draw, but recently I am just too busy working on things.

While I am usually busy working on day job and personal projects most of the time, I am happy to help fellow developers. I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkesgar) interacting with fellow web developers. I also lurk on several communities at Telegram or Discord; feel free to say hi if you spot me.
