# Hello there.

My name is Ted Kesgar.

I am an ITB graduate with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. Currently I work at Bukalapak and live in Jakarta. During my spare time, I am working on my pet project [Charaverse](https://github.com/chverse) and maintain the [Nusa League](https://github.com/nusaleague) website. To make working on things easier, I sometimes create public npm packages that everyone can inspect and use ([sharo](https://github.com/tkesgar/sharo), [@tkesgar/haru](https://github.com/tkesgar/haru), [@tkesgar/ariadoa](https://github.com/tkesgar/ariadoa)). I mainly use Node.js and JavaScript/TypeScript nowadays.

I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkesgar) interacting with fellow web developers, and I occassionally write on [my blog](https://blog.tkesgar.com). I enjoy football and Japanese anime/manga.

While I usually busy work on my things most of the time, I am happy to help fellow developers. Feel free to contact me if you spot me somewhere.
