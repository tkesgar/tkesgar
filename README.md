# Hello there.

My name is Ted Kesgar.

I am an ITB graduate with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. Currently I work at [@bukalapak](https://github.com/bukalapak) and live in Jakarta. During my spare time, I work on various personal projects; to make working on things easier, I often create public packages that I and everyone else can inspect and use ([sharo](https://github.com/tkesgar/sharo), [@tkesgar/haru](https://github.com/tkesgar/haru), [@tkesgar/ariadoa](https://github.com/tkesgar/ariadoa)). I mainly use Node.js and JavaScript/TypeScript nowadays.

Aside of programming, I enjoy Japanese pop culture, playing video games, and watch football (mostly English football).

While I am usually busy work on day job and personal projects most of the time, I am happy to help fellow developers. I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkesgar) interacting with fellow web developers, and I also lurk on several Indonesian online programming communities. Feel free to say hi if you spot me.
